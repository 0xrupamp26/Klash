## 🎯 What is Klash?

**Klash** is a revolutionary Web3 prediction market platform that transforms how people engage with online controversies and debates. We leverage AI to automatically detect trending debates on Twitter/X, create instant prediction markets, and resolve them transparently using sentiment analysis—all settled on-chain via Aptos blockchain.

Think of it as **"Twitter meets DeFi casino"**—where every viral argument, cultural debate, or trending controversy becomes a tradable market where you can back your opinion with real money.

### 🌟 The Vision

In a world where everyone has opinions but few are held accountable, Klash creates a marketplace for conviction. We're building the infrastructure for **provable social consensus**—where the internet's collective wisdom is quantified, traded, and settled transparently on-chain.

---

## 🔴 The Problem We're Solving

### **1. Debates Without Resolution**
Every day, millions argue on social media about sports, politics, crypto, and culture—but these debates rarely have definitive outcomes or accountability.

### **2. Disconnected Prediction Markets**
Existing prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) are:
- **Slow**: Manual curation takes days
- **Disconnected**: Not where culture happens (Twitter/X)
- **Limited**: Focus only on major political/economic events
- **Single-chain**: Locked to one blockchain ecosystem

### **3. Lack of Trust in Resolution**
Traditional betting platforms use centralized oracles or moderators, creating trust issues and slow settlement times.

### **4. Web3 Adoption Gap**
Most Web3 apps have poor UX and aren't built around social virality—the primary driver of internet culture.

---
